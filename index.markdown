<h1>Welcome to TECH41!</h1>
<p>We are a small development company based in Hamburg/Germany.</p>
<p>We are building high performance audio applications for mobile and desktop as well as VST, VST3, AU, AUv3, AAX and LV2 plug-ins.</p>
<p>User Interfaces are typically build native using Swift on IoS and Kotlin on Android.</p>
<p>DSP code is developed in C/C++ using SIMD instructions, Accelerate for IoS and Neon for Android.</p>
<p>Beside orchestrating Core Audio and Oboe DSP code can also leverage the <a href="https://juce.com/" target="_blank">Juce framework</a>.</p>
<p>More complex user interface requirements can be handled using OpenGL, Vulkan or Metal.</p>
<p>A further option is the integration of game engines like Godot or Unity, for example to combine Audio and Video to create Visual FX triggered by Midi or OSC.</p>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@tech41.de">info@tech41.de</a></p>
